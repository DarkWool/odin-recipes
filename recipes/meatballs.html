	<h2>Description.</h2>
	<p>A meatball recipe that rivals that of your favorite Italian restaurant! These meatballs always come out amazingly tender, deliciously flavorful, never dry and they’re always sure to impress! Here you’ll learn everything you need to know to make them perfect every time.</p>
	
	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
		<li>½ pound ground veal</li>
		<li>½ pound ground pork</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>2 eggs</li>
		<li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
		<li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
		<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		<li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
		<li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
		<li>1 cup olive oil</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Steps:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.</li>
		<li>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.</li>
		<li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)</li>
	</ol>
